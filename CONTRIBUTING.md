# Contributing to unda

Thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

As a singular college student working on this crate for fun to better understand rust and machine learning it really does mean a lot :)

## Development

### Running code locally

Assuming you downloaded unda to `/home/user/unda` and you want to run
the crate locally, it's relatively self explanatory as you would run any rust project:
```bash
cd /home/user/unda
cargo build --release
./target/release/unda
```
Once changes are made, please make a new branch and submit a PR :)

### Running tests

Nothing special, just `cargo test`.
